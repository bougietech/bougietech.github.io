title: Download Images from Google Maps in Full Resolution - no addons or extensions
published: true

Here is a way to download high resolution images from Google Maps without additional software or browser extensions.

1. Right-click a picture from the list on the left and click inspect.
2. Above the highlighted element should be a div with role="img" that contains a image URL.
3. Near the end of the URL, replace the w###-h### with s16383 and save as a picture.

Presumably,
```
w = width
h = height
s = size
```

The image contains the original metadata too, which is interesting.



Why 16383?
Entering any number larger than the largest dimension of the original image will download the original file from what I can tell. I discovered by trial and error that 16383 is the largest number it will accept. Apparently 16383 = 0x3FFF the maximum value that can be expressed with 14 bits, a limitation of the Webp image format.
