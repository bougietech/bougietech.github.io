title: Integrating CardDAV server with FreePBX for Caller ID
published: false
---

When helping a client migrate from a cell phone to a FreePBX VOIP phone system, I was looking for a good contact management system. The main requirement was a way to display the names of saved contacts on the IP phones for incoming calls.

Many VOIP handsets have an LDAP phonebook feature. When a call comes in, they can query an LDAP server with the phone number and display the name if a contact with a matching number is found.

### L2CPBG
Most contact management systems I am aware of support the CardDAV protocol but not LDAP. So I was happy to discover [this project](https://projects.shbe.net/projects/l2cpbg). L2CPBG = LDAP-to-CardDAV Phone Book Gateway. This lightweight utility acts as a bridge between LDAP-capable phones and a CardDAV server such as Synology Contacts or Nextcloud Contacts.

The project isn't opensource, but the developer is responsive and helpful. There is a free version with limitations, and the dev is happy to provide a license key for testing.

I installed the `.deb` package on a Ubuntu machine and edited the settings in `/etc/l2cpbg.conf`, most of which are self-explanatory.

Here is where the LDAP server and CardDAV sources are configured:
```
[ldap]
  host      = "0.0.0.0"
  port      = 1389
  base      = "dc=l2cpbg, dc=com"

[ldap.bind]
  dn   = "cn=phone"
  pass = "my_secure_password"

[dav]
  server       = "http://url-to-shared-addressbook-in-synology-contacts"
  user         = "synology_username"
  pass         = "secure_synology_password"

addressbooks = "My Contacts"
```
### Configuring LDAP on handsets
You can configure VOIP handsets to query the L2CPBG server. This allows Number>Name lookups for incoming calls as well as Name>Number searches from the handset (depending on your particular handset's features).

Config details vary among phone manufacturers. Here is a screenshot from the web interface of a Grandstream WP825 handset:

### Configuring LDAP on FreePBX
In my case, I encountered inconsistencies in the way the LDAP phonebook feature is implemented on the different phones I was using. Also, the PBX was unaware of the LDAP phonebook, so Call Detail Records did not reflect the correct name.

So I pivoted to configuring LDAP lookup directly within FreePBX. It turns out, this is not very difficult to do.

I'm using FreePBX 17. In the web console, navigate to Admin > CID Superfecta.

Click on the schema named `Default`. This will show the available methods for Caller ID lookup. Find the LDAP entry, click Enable, then use the arrow to move it to the top of the list.

Then click the wrench icon to edit settings. Here is a screenshot of the configs I used:

Apparently the Host field requires a domain; it does not work with an IP address. So I used `l2cpbg.com` which matches the LDAP configurations in L2CPBG. Then I added an entry to `/etc/hosts` on the FreePBX machine to map l2cpbg.com to the ip address of the L2CPBG server.

`nano /etc/hosts`
```
10.8.0.7    l2cpbg.com
```
Then on the handset, I uncheck the box so it will not do a lookup for incoming calls. Rather FreePBX does a single lookup and then uses the returned name (if there is a match) to over-write the Caller ID information before sending the call out to the phones. This also has the advantage of showing the correct name in the Call Log in FreePBX.
